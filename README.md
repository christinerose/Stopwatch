+App made in Udemy course. I was able to do much more of this one on my own, but I still needed help from the video.
+
+I'm hoping this went up on GitHub properly, as I'm so confused by this. I think it's because I just don't do it everyday, so I forget between times.
+
+I uploaded this now so I can make some changes to the app and then upload a revision.

+This is the basic app, and now I'm going to try to combine the 4 buttons into two.
